R code for "No association between personality and candidate gene polymorphisms in a wild bird population" PLOS ONE.

Studies of wild bird populations have shown that exploratory behaviour is associated with polymorphisms in DRD4. 
Additionally high levels of anxiety, a characteristic of bold behaviour, and exploratory behaviour have been 
associated with polymorphisms in SERT. Here we tested for polymorphisms in DRD4 and SERT in the Seychelles 
warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) population on Cousin Island, Seychelles, and then investigated correlations 
between personality and polymorphisms in these genes.
